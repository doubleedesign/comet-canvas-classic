# Comet Canvas (Classic)

WordPress parent theme to support the intended implementation of Comet Components [Comet Components](https://cometcomponents.io) in WordPress "classic" and ClassicPress themes with ACF Pro Flexible Content Modules for customisable content layouts.

## Usage
Comet Canvas is intended to be used as a parent theme. In addition to the standard template hierarchy for overriding templates, the `CometCanvas` class is configured to look for child classes overriding its own classes and instantiates those automatically, allowing for straightforward overriding of methods at the source rather than doing things in child themes like unregistering menus from the parent theme.

## Development
If you're reading this from GitHub, you're seeing the mirror of the [Comet Components Canvas package](https://github.com/doubleedesign/comet-components/tree/master/packages/comet-canvas) that is here for the purposes of publishing to Packagist and installing via Composer.

Development of this project belongs in the main Comet Components monorepo.
